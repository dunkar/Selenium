# Selenium

Purpose: To build a framework around the Selenium WebDriver to simplify the
basic capabilities that are most frequently used (in my experience anyway).

# Instructions
- Install Python version 3
- Install the selenium bindings for Python: `pip install selenium`
- Install the SeleniumFramework.py file into a location searchable by Python
    - i.e. site-packages or the folder containing your test scripts
- In your test script: `import SeleniumFramework`
